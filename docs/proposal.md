# 2. Background
### What is it about?
The challenge of identifying fake photos or videos created with deep learning techniques is called DeepFake Detection. Deepfakes are produced by manipulating or replacing certain elements of an original video or image, like a person's face, using machine learning algorithms. Finding these kind of alterations and differentiating them from authentic videos or images is the aim of deepfake detection.

### Why does it matter?
Recent social media scandals involving the replacement of famous people's faces in pornographic films cause grave injury to a person's reputation and permanently damage the identities of both famous and common people, necessitating the development of techniques to identify Deepfake.
Furthermore, it poses a serious risk to the security of biometric data and encourages other fraudulent and counterfeiting actions. DeepFake can be easily implemented by several face-swapping apps like Face2Face and mobile apps like Snapchat that use pre-trained generative adversarial networks.

# 3. Dataset
[Link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjilkarki/deepfake-and-real-images/data)
The data is obtained from the source Kaggle. 
- **Data Size:** 46.7MB
- **Data Shape:** The images are divided into train, test and validation sets. All images in the dataset are preprocessed and resized to a resolution of 256 x 256 image of a human face which is either real or fake.There are 610 training images with 900 validation images and 2410 test samples. There are two classes, Fake and Real.
